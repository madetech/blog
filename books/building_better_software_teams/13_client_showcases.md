# Client Showcases

At Made we deliver regular client showcases, this is an opportunity to sit down with the client to discuss how the iteration and the project as a whole are progressing.

## Who should be involved with a showcase?
- Customers
- Internal showcases to expose learnings to wider team, and promote adoption of X, Y, Z

## Why do good software teams showcase?
- To keep customers informed of current progress.
- To keep client and developer expectations aligned.
- Demonstrate and teach processes to the end user.
- Collect feedback on ways the work could be improved.

## Introducing better showcases into your team
-

## Preparation
- List what you want to cover, which includes work complete and generally issues uncovered.
- Practice the showcase internally, particularly when its the end of an iteration.
- Timebox the presentation and leave time for questions.

## Mid point showcases
- Emphasise work in progress when there are incomplete features.
- Set up client expectations if you feel you won't complete the piece of work by the end of the iteration and give clear honest reasons behind this.
- Are an opportunity to change scope of the iteration or stop it entirely, if you or the customer feels it necessary.
- Are an opportunity to ensure the team is delivering the functionality (eg frontend behaviour) the client expected.
- Are an opportunity for your team to suggest improvements or potential issues to the customer.

## End of iteration showcases
- Champion Unseen Wins.
- Emphasise Value.
- Expose complexity where it existed. This builds your client's confidence in your teams ability to deliver technical work and solve problems.
- Champion value where it isn't immediately obvious, point out areas where you believe your proactive work will help save the customer time and money.

## Capturing useful feedback
- Keep the feedback on point, only related to the demonstrated functionality.
- Don't go into too much detail. You want enough to be able to triage it later, but no too much that the showcase gets de-railed or takes forever.
