# Client Showcases

At Made we deliver regular client showcases, this is an opportunity to sit down with the client to discuss how the iteration and the project as a whole are progressing.

## Who should be involved with a showcase?
<!-- - Clients -->
<!-- - Talking to people in the clients business who actually will use the product. -->

The most important people to be involved in a showcase are the developers working on the iteration, the key stakeholders on the clients side. A showcase cannot happen without these people. Additionally, any members of the client's business whose lives will be improved by the work carried out ought to be involved. For example, a customer service representative or an ecommerce manager. These people will have valuable, on the ground, insights into existing problems it should solve and potential challenges the work may introduce before its too late.

- Members of your wider team or department

## Why do good software teams showcase?
<!-- - To keep clients informed of current progress. -->
<!-- - To keep client and developer expectations aligned. -->
<!-- - Demonstrate and teach processes to the end user. -->
<!-- - Collect feedback on ways the work could be improved. -->
<!-- - Line up the next iteration. -->
<!-- - To expose learnings to wider team or department, and promote adoption of X, Y, Z -->

A showcase is a prime time to get your work in front of all key stakeholders to demonstrate how your work is progressing, and how this impacts the project and their business. It is extremely important to have these regularly, to ensure client and developer expectations are kept in sync. Without this regular contact point delivered work may fall short in some areas and over-deliver in other areas, both of which are a waste of developer time and the clients resources. By instead ensuring you and your client are on the same page, everybody will be happy with the delivered iteration, and any potential problems will surface before it's too late, again saving time and money.

Additionally, by involving people in the showcase who will actually personally benefit from the work being done, this gives you an opportunity to demonstrate and teach processes and functionality to these end users. We notice this in particular when building new tools for businesses. Overall it reduces the time spent up-skilling these people later on, and gives them a good opportunity to recommend improvements.

Furthermore, a showcase is an excellent forum to openly discuss any feedback the client may have on the past iteration and the shape of the project in general, and to line up the goals of the next iteration if relevant.

We have found it useful to hold internal showcases to team members not on project team to update everyone on what the team have achieved, what they've learned, any practices the wider team should adopt or avoid, and any technical achievements that could be co-op'd into other projects.

## Introducing better showcases into your team
-

## Preparation
- List what you want to cover, which includes work complete and generally issues uncovered.
- Practice the showcase internally, particularly when its the end of an iteration.
- Timebox the presentation and leave time for questions.

## Mid point showcases
- Emphasise work in progress when there are incomplete features.
- Set up client expectations if you feel you won't complete the piece of work by the end of the iteration and give clear honest reasons behind this.
- Are an opportunity to change scope of the iteration or stop it entirely, if you or the client feels it necessary.
- Are an opportunity to ensure the team is delivering the functionality (eg frontend behaviour) the client expected.
- Are an opportunity for your team to suggest improvements or potential issues to the client.

## End of iteration showcases
- Champion Unseen Wins.
- Emphasise Value.
- Expose complexity where it existed. This builds your client's confidence in your teams ability to deliver technical work and solve problems.
- Champion value where it isn't immediately obvious, point out areas where you believe your proactive work will help save the client time and money.

## Capturing useful feedback/How to deal with it
- Keep the feedback on point, only related to the demonstrated functionality.
- Don't go into too much detail. You want enough to be able to triage it later, but no too much that the showcase gets de-railed or takes forever.
