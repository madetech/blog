# Client Showcases

At Made we deliver regular client showcases, this is an opportunity to sit down with the client to discuss how the iteration and the project as a whole are progressing.

## Who should be involved with a showcase?
<!-- - Clients -->
<!-- - Talking to people in the clients business who actually will use the product. -->

The most important people to be involved in a showcase are the developers working on the iteration, the key stakeholders on the clients side. A showcase cannot happen without these people. Additionally, any members of the client's business whose lives will be improved by the work carried out ought to be involved. For example, a customer service representative or an ecommerce manager. These people will have valuable, on the ground, insights into existing problems it should solve and potential challenges the work may introduce before its too late.

- Members of your wider team or department

## Why do good software teams showcase?
<!-- - To keep clients informed of current progress. -->
<!-- - To keep client and developer expectations aligned. -->
<!-- - Demonstrate and teach processes to the end user. -->
<!-- - Collect feedback on ways the work could be improved. -->
<!-- - Line up the next iteration. -->
<!-- - To expose learnings to wider team or department, and promote adoption of X, Y, Z -->

A showcase is a prime time to get your work in front of all key stakeholders to demonstrate how your work is progressing, and how this impacts the project and their business. It is extremely important to have these regularly, to ensure client and developer expectations are kept in sync. Without this regular contact point delivered work may fall short in some areas and over-deliver in other areas, both of which are a waste of developer time and the clients resources. By instead ensuring you and your client are on the same page, everybody will be happy with the delivered iteration, and any potential problems will surface before it's too late, again saving time and money.

Additionally, by involving people in the showcase who will actually personally benefit from the work being done, this gives you an opportunity to demonstrate and teach processes and functionality to these end users. We notice this in particular when building new tools for businesses. Overall it reduces the time spent up-skilling these people later on, and gives them a good opportunity to recommend improvements.

Furthermore, a showcase is an excellent forum to openly discuss any feedback the client may have on the past iteration and the shape of the project in general, and to line up the goals of the next iteration if relevant.

We have found it useful to hold internal showcases to team members not on project team to update everyone on what the team have achieved, what they've learned, any practices the wider team should adopt or avoid, and any technical achievements that could be co-op'd into other projects.

## Introducing better showcases into your team
<!-- - Frequency - more feedback opportunities = better -->
<!-- - Structure - enforce good structure in your showcases, make sure the first and most important part is telling them what you've been up, and not allowing interruptions or tangents to take place. -->

Things which are important to consider when introducing showcases in a project are structure and frequency. Enforcing good structure in your showcases will ensure the time is well spent for all parties. Make sure the first and most important part of the showcase is demonstrating what you've been up to, discussing any problems you faced and solved and any problems you still have, and not allowing interruptions or tangents to take place until the end. The benefit of this is clients have time to consider, condense and prioritise feedback, and those leading the showcase are able to make all of their points undistracted.

Additionally, showcases provide a personal growth opportunity for developers. We believe showcases should be led by developers. This puts a certain amount of pressure on them, but we think it's beneficial pressure to have. This is because they are the people with the best understanding of the work, the people who can most easily gauge and accept feedback and the people who will have to carry out the rest of the work. Additionally, it encourages their best work as they know they will have to stand up and be accountable for it in front of clients. We've found this kind of growth is often best achieved by pushing people in at the deep end and providing them with a float, rather than wading them in gently. This sink or swim approach sounds brutal, but encourages autonomy and personal confidence in the individual.

## Preparation
<!-- - List what you want to cover, which includes work complete and generally issues uncovered.
- Practice the showcase internally, particularly when its the end of an iteration. -->
<!-- - Timebox the presentation and leave time for questions. -->

During an iteration we find it useful to keep note of all the wins and challenges we've had, on top of the tasks we've completed. This enables us to easily prepare a run down of the iteration. These run down documents then get stored inside the project, similar to a changelog to provide a contextual history of a project.

After the run down has been prepared it is often valuable to run through it with other members of the project team to ensure smooth delivery, and catch any shortcomings, complexity, and omissions. This is particularly important when finishing an iteration where it is important to put your best foot forward and deliver a slick demo.

Additionally, a practiced showcase enables you to efficiently time-box the demonstration, as an ideal showcase lasts a maximum of 10-15 minutes. If you find your showcases are longer than this, consider shortening your iteration times and focusing on smaller chunks of work. Keeping it concise also means you also allow time for questions, feedback, and thoughtful discussions about the work presented.

## Mid point showcases
- Emphasise work in progress when there are incomplete features.
- Set up client expectations if you feel you won't complete the piece of work by the end of the iteration and give clear honest reasons behind this.
- Focus on high priority features that are important to the client.
- Are an opportunity to change scope of the iteration or stop it entirely, if you or the client feels it necessary.
- Are an opportunity to ensure the team is delivering the functionality (eg frontend behaviour) the client expected.
- Are an opportunity for your team to suggest improvements or potential issues to the client.

## End of iteration showcases
- Champion Unseen Wins.
- Emphasise Value.
- Expose complexity where it existed. This builds your client's confidence in your teams ability to deliver technical work and solve problems.
- Champion value where it isn't immediately obvious, point out areas where you believe your proactive work will help save the client time and money.

## Capturing useful feedback/How to deal with it
- Keep the feedback on point, only related to the demonstrated functionality.
- Don't go into too much detail. You want enough to be able to triage it later, but no too much that the showcase gets de-railed or takes forever.
