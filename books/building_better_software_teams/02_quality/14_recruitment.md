# Recruiting a tech team

Recruiting the right group of people is one of the most important parts of building an effective software delivery function. In this article, we take a look at some things you should consider when recruiting a team and some of the things that you should watch out for.

## Create a cohesive culture
A big component of building an effective software delivery team is creating a cohesion culture. A cohesive culture is achieved when a team feels empowered to participate, can collaborate effectively and gets recognition for it's successes. To achieve this, you need the right leadership, the right mix of experience, and people with character traits that encourage cohesion.

When recruiting, you should be thinking about how to achieve a cohesion culture. Often when recruiting for software teams, people recruit with specific technical skills in mind, but we've found that it's just as important to consider other softer skills such as:

 * Is this person a team player?
 * Are they able to communicate effectively?
 * Do they take responsibility or blame others?
 * Do they have a positive outlook?

Although there isn't a 'one size fits all' approach to creating a cohesive culture, there are certainly signs that you can look out for during an interview process. It's important to watch out for these, and when you see them, question whether the candidate is somebody that will help encourage cohesion, or fight against it.

## Don't hire rockstars, ninjas or self-proclaimed superstars
It's obviously important to hire talented people, but never hire anyone who considers themselves a 'rockstar' engineer. It's a sign of ego and self worth and a sure fire way to create a divided team.

Of course you want exception people on your team, just make sure they are humble and able to put their skills to good use, improving the team.

## Leverage network
It's nearly always better to recruit through your existing network. Either through people you have worked with previously, or through contacts your team have within industry.

The team should understand the needs of the organisation and what it is like to work there and their relationship with a candidate means they will already know a lot more than can be discovered during an interview process.

These kind of network referrals are the best indication you'll get as to whether or not a candidate will be successful, so favour them over other recruitment routes.

## Referral bonuses
It's become fairly common for organizations to offer incentives to staff to help encourage recruitment referrals. In our experience, good people will automatically want to bring their most talented friends and acquaintances along. Offering incentives can help, and may result in a few additional hires, but it's questionable as to whether carrot and stick motivation ultimately lead to stronger teams.  

Our advise would be to focus on building a great culture, which your team are proud of and their network of acquaintances are eager to join. You can still thank people for referrals, but hopefully you'll find that by flipping the motivation model from extrinsic to intrinsic, you'll end up in a happier place.

##  Strive for diversity
Itâ€™s no secret that many software teams struggle with diversity. While there are a number of factors limiting progress, it's important that you consider diversity when recruiting. There are steps that you can take, such as:

* Helping people to reduce unconscious bias
* Capturing and reviewing data that highlights diversity within your organisationa
* Scrutinizing job advertisements and internal practices, to ensure they don't unintentionally discourage certain demographics.

Whatever you do, make sure diversity is on your radar. It's important that

## Keep it interesting. Increase retention
One of the challenges you'll face after you've recruited some good people, is keeping them around. If they are talented and based in a decent location, then they are likely to have many career paths open to them.

It's fairly common to see companies offer perks and incentives to help encourage employees to stick around. In our experience, the most important thing is to ensure they can keep on learning, improving and getting better. This means having work which is challenging, that is going to push them to get better. If this dries up and day-to-day becomes mundane, you'll often find people won't stick around.

## Don't use contractors
The software industry has a large large number of people who work as contractors within the software delivery. We

## Embrace juniors

## Liberation
It's human nature to avoid making difficult decisions. Nobody wants to be fired, or to have to tell someone that they no longer have a job. However, when faced with this scenario, it's vital that you act quickly and let them go as soon as possible.

It's a sad truth that many organisations end up carrying underperforming team members for years. This can have a big impact on morale and wider team performance, so it's important that the situation is dealt with.

## Overpay within industry
