Give Teams Ownership of Delivery
================================

It's a poorly kept secret that increasing levels of responsibility, particularly with knowledge workers, often correlates to an increase in performance.

We strive to have the team dedicated to a software project responsible and accountable for the end-to-end delivery: from initial requirements capture, right through to launching and supporting the application.


## Shaping the Team

When pulling together a new team, it's important to consider the blend of skills that you need. We tend to shy away from specialist roles, such as DBAs or dedicated testers, though we do see value in ensuring a healthy mix of experience levels on a team.

We use traits to encourage people to work toward desirable skills, one of which is +delivery, covering process improvements, understanding commercial objectives, and ensuring customer needs are met. Other organisations may choose to recognise similar attributes in other ways, such as through team lead or related titles. Whatever your flavour, it's sensible to consider having an experienced pair of hands in the team with the nous to nudge things in the right direction.

On the flipside, it's wise to be wary of conflict in teams where everyone is chasing the same personal objective. Having a mix of people skilled in a number of different areas who can coach and upskill other members in their various strengths is a positive place to be.


## Empowering the Team

Successful team empowerment typically comes from blending expectations, responsibility with accountability. Without these forces working in balance, you're likely headed for frustration.

It's firstly important to instil a sense of responsibility that everything from understanding what the customer needs, right through to launching the thing in production is down to them.

Depending on the culture in your team and wider organisation, you may need to do some work to set expectations on what you expect the team to be achieving. This should shy away from task-level goals, but be a higher level goal - perhaps something along the lines of: increasing customer happiness through delivering valuable, working software regularly.

Once you've done this, your next step is to not interfere. For many managers, this part is particularly tricky.

Your only responsibility from here on in should be to hold the team to account for meeting their commitments and for delivering to the expectations that you've agreed.


## Task Teams with Problems, not Solutions

Ensure that the team are being engaged at the correct level. If you're looking to encourage strategic, rather than just tactical skills, don't ask the team to deliver a pre-defined solution to the problem.

Instead, ensure the team are empowered with, and over time, are actively seeking out an understanding of the commercial goals behind each and every feature.

Have the team take responsibility for identifying and then delivering solutions to these commercial problems, rather than executing against a pre-baked task list. This ownership of the fuller problem should help accelerate a feeling of empowerment.


## Be Prepared to Accept Mistakes

When relinquishing any kind of control, or when trying to increase the empowerment of others, it's highly likely that many things will not be done quite as you would have done them yourself, or quite how you may have asked others to do them if you were managing a more task-based workload for the team.

It's important to quickly come to terms with this, and equally important to be prepared to accept that mistakes will be made. Wherever possible, you'll need to allow the team to make mistakes, even where there's a cost involved, and where you can clearly foresee the problem.

If you're overly keen to jump back in and provide input, you'll too easily undo the work involved in imparting a true sense of responsibility and empowerment, and before you know it, members of the team will be deferring decision making outside of the team.

You should try to see your role as preventing the team from jumping off a cliff, but not much more.


## Ensure You're Being Asked the Right Questions

Particularly with newly empowered teams, you should make yourself open to discussing strategies with the team. However, you should be careful to avoid allowing the team to too easily devolve lower-level decision making your way.

A quick and easy technique is when asked a question, first ask the other person what they think the best course of action is. Even if you'd consider doing things differently, unless what's being proposed is significantly detrimental, let the team run with it without providing input.


## Upskilling the Team

There are a number of areas in which you could consider upskilling the team, particularly if increased responsibility and empowerment is likely to be new for them.

### Delivery Mindset

If someone has spent much of their time being spoon-fed tasks, and then executing them, it's likely some work is needed to coach more of a delivery mindset.

This involves thinking at a slightly higher level about how to best move from a stated problem, to working, released software. Likely this will entail higher level of communication with customers, helping shape priorities, identifying and articulating solutions, and ensuring there's an appropriate framework in place to facilitate fast delivery and fast feedback.

### Customer Service

Many organisations make the mistake of hiding their engineers away from the customer, instead relying on a middleman to collate requirements, showcase the software, and generally keep the customer happy.

### Understanding the Problem

### Commercial Understanding

People in high performance roles should be tasked with problems, not half-baked solutions
