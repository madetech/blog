Give Teams Ownership of Delivery
================================

It's a poorly kept secret that increasing levels of responsibility, particularly with knowledge workers, often correlates to an increase in performance.

We strive to have the team dedicated to a software project responsible and accountable for the end-to-end delivery: from initial requirements capture, right through to launching and supporting the application.


## Shaping the Team

When pulling together a new team, it's important to consider the blend of skills that you need. We tend to shy away from specialist roles, such as DBAs or dedicated testers, though we do see value in ensuring a healthy mix of experience levels on a team.

We use traits to encourage people to work toward desirable skills, one of which is +delivery, covering process improvements, understanding commercial objectives, and ensuring customer needs are met. Other organisations may choose to recognise similar attributes in other ways, such as through team lead or related titles. Whatever your flavour, it's sensible to consider having an experienced pair of hands in the team with the nous to nudge things in the right direction.

On the flipside, it's wise to be wary of conflict in teams where everyone is chasing the same personal objective. Having a mix of people skilled in a number of different areas who can coach and upskill other members in their various strengths is a positive place to be.


## Empowering the Team

Successful team empowerment typically comes from blending expectations, responsibility with accountability. Without these forces working in balance, you're likely headed for frustration.

It's firstly important to instil a sense of responsibility that everything from understanding what the customer needs, right through to launching the thing in production is down to them.

Depending on the culture in your team and wider organisation, you may need to do some work to set expectations on what you expect the team to be achieving. This should shy away from task-level goals, but be a higher level goal - perhaps something along the lines of: increasing customer happiness through delivering valuable, working software regularly.

Once you've done this, your next step is to not interfere. For many managers, this part is particularly tricky.

Your only responsibility from here on in should be to hold the team to account for meeting their commitments and for delivering to the expectations that you've agreed.


## Task Teams with Problems, not Solutions

Ensure that the team are being engaged at the correct level. If you're looking to encourage strategic, rather than just tactical skills, don't ask the team to deliver a pre-defined solution to the problem.

Instead, ensure the team are empowered with, and over time, are actively seeking out an understanding of the commercial goals behind each and every feature.

Have the team take responsibility for identifying and then delivering solutions to these commercial problems, rather than executing against a pre-baked task list. This ownership of the fuller problem should help accelerate a feeling of empowerment.


## Be Prepared to Accept Mistakes

When relinquishing any kind of control, or when trying to increase the empowerment of others, it's highly likely that many things will not be done quite as you would have done them yourself, or quite how you may have asked others to do them if you were managing a more task-based workload for the team.

It's important to quickly come to terms with this, and equally important to be prepared to accept that mistakes will be made. Wherever possible, you'll need to allow the team to make mistakes, even where there's a cost involved, and where you can clearly foresee the problem.

If you're overly keen to jump back in and provide input, you'll too easily undo the work involved in imparting a true sense of responsibility and empowerment, and before you know it, members of the team will be deferring decision making outside of the team.

You should try to see your role as preventing the team from jumping off a cliff, but not much more.


## Ensure You're Being Asked the Right Questions

Particularly with newly empowered teams, you should make yourself open to discussing strategies with the team. However, you should be careful to avoid allowing the team to too easily devolve lower-level decision making your way.

A quick and easy technique is when asked a question, first ask the other person what they think the best course of action is. Even if you'd consider doing things differently, unless you believe what's being proposed is significantly detrimental, let the team run with it without providing input.


## Point of Contact

In most engineering teams, it's natural for there to be a primary point of contact for the Product Owner, Customer, or similar role. It's of paramount importance that this primary day-to-day contact be someone in the team, rather than having communication fed through intermediaries, particularly those more senior within the organisation.

Having communication come from a conduit outside the team disempowers the team from building direct relationships with those commissioning the software, and it hinders open conversations that help engineers better understand the true commercial objectives and pressures.

The point of contact is unquestionably an important role within the team, particularly if you provide consultancy-like services to other organisations. You should be conscious to invest in upskilling, nurturing, and providing regular support to those new to this role.


## Upskilling the Team

There are a number of areas in which you could consider upskilling the team, particularly if increased responsibility and empowerment is likely to be new for them.

### Delivery Mindset

If someone has spent much of their time being assigned tasks, and then executing them, it's likely some work is needed to coach more of a delivery mindset.

This involves thinking at a slightly higher level about how to best move from a stated problem, to working, released software. Likely this will entail higher level of communication with customers, helping shape priorities, identifying and articulating solutions, and ensuring there's an appropriate framework in place to facilitate fast delivery and fast feedback.

### Customer Service

Many organisations make the mistake of hiding their engineers away from the customer, instead relying on a middleman to collate requirements, showcase the software, and generally keep the customer happy.

You should encourage a solutions focused culture, where engineers see their role as facilitating the customer, be it an internal or external stakeholder, in achieving their commercial goals. Ensuring regular and open communication, and regular showcasing of the software can go a long way.

### Understanding the Problem

If your team have historically been focused more on solving task-based problems, coaching is likely to be necessary to help in how to better gain an understanding of the higher level problem to be solved. Consider encouraging communication with the end user, support in navigating organisations to reach the true stakeholders, and relentless questioning of why requirements are important.

### Commercial Understanding

In some organisation, you may observe engineers shielded or otherwise isolated from the commercial drivers behind software deliveries. In the worst cases, which are thankfully a little less common nowadays, engineers can be tasked with building libraries with specific interfaces, with no understanding of what's going to be interacting with this interface.

Instead, we believe people perform best when they understand the domain in which they're working, and when they understand the commercial goals that the software is supposed to solve. Empowered with this understanding, coupled with their software engineering know-how, engineers can often propose easier and cheaper solutions to achieve the same aim.


## Keeping Teams Accountable

An important, and sometimes overlooked trait when increasing ownership within teams is putting in place appropriate mechanisms to hold the team to account for unacceptable deliveries.

As a consequence of empowering the team with higher level responsibilities, you'll often see teams naturally holding themselves to higher account. This is the ideal culture to be building.

That said, it's likely that, given enough iterations, even amongst teams who have plenty of experience with higher levels of empowerment, there will be occasions where less desirable performance will be observed and should be surfaced.

To avoid disempowering the team, it is suggested to give higher level feedback, and to allow the time to digest and work out solutions without taking involvement. Describe the situation that you observed as undesirable, and explain the reasons you feel this way.

You should use this mechanism sparingly, as its effectiveness is likely to be reduced the more you lean on it. If you find it necessary to follow this recourse every week or so, it's likely you've got larger root problems that need to be addressed, or that you're not truly comfortable in allowing the team to be fully empowered.


## Supporting Teams from the Outside

While a large part of encouraging ownership is allowing teams to operate more autonomously, it's important to also offer an appropriate level of support.

It's important to keep front of mind that you need to provide this support from outside of the team to avoid undermining the team's autonomy.

Ideally, you should encourage a culture where a team will proactively ask for help or input when they feel they need it. Offering up too much assistance can have an undermining influence, even when well intended.

You should consciously aim to always ask the other person, or the team, how they think to best handle the situation before offering up your own solution, further nurturing independent thinking.

The nature of the team and the individual will dictate the best way to provide support. For some people, carving out a small dedicated amount of time each week may provide a good forum for supporting, for others, you may find you naturally have more informal conversations throughout the day.
