# Learning From Mistakes

- it's built into us to assign blame when something goes wrong
  - tolerating mistakes is a skill

- mistakes are going to happen when we're undertaking work that isn't routine

- mistakes a crucial part of learning, discovery and experimentation
  - for example, failure within routine operations could be a sign that the operation is too complex
  - “We’re in the discovery business, and the faster we fail, the faster we’ll succeed.”

- embracing failure does not mean encouraging people to be deviant
  - inattention could be deviant behaviour, but it could also be a sign that your employees are burnt out

- detecting mistakes

- analyzing mistakes

- promoting experimentation
