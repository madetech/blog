# Communication

Delivering software well is hard. You need to master your language, framework and toolchain. You need to constantly refine processes to manage the flow of work. You need to stay on top of the constantly evolving technology landscape. But more than all of this, you'll almost certainly need to work with others in some capacity.

While mastering the craft of software development is critical to delivering good software, a great many problems can be overcome with improved communication.

Creating an environment that values regular and open communication, both within the team delivering the product, and with the wider stakeholder team, can go a long way to removing impediments in the delivery process.

In this first section of the book, we introduce strategies you can implement to promote a culture of communication and continuous introspection, ranging from pair programming to overhauling your feedback mechanisms.
