##Recognition (Craig)

A downside of only having individual recognition is that it can introduce competition. To receive recognition, you must excel compared to your colleagues. Unfortunately, this can lead to unhealthy environments and slow degradation of teamwork. 

By contrast, cultures with only full team recognition lead to a marked increase in amounts of cooperation and collaboration, as this is the only way to achieve success.  The downside of team-only recognition is that it can go awry when individuals begin to feel that underperformers are receiving just as much reward for their actions.

Another solution seen in other cultures is never to recognise anyone for fear of causing these problems. It is important to consider that this will begin to cause individuals to feel unvalued.

Although we value individual recognition, we favour team recognition. We also believe that people should be recognised primarily through ad-hoc channels, by their peers, not by whoever sits above them in the hierarchy. We use continuous feedback as a platform for this recognition. 

It's important to recognise the highly positive impact that recognising teams and individuals has on morale. Also, and potentially more importantly, the disturbing implications of poorly handling mistakes as well. 

In a high safety, high trust environment, with practices such as continuous feedback and retrospectives, the detection of a mistake should not be seen as an opportunity for a chastising or otherwise attacking the individual(s) responsible for that mistake.

Morale can be boosted during periods of adversity too, through robust, mature methods for picking up the pieces after a mistake has made. Using mistakes as opportunities to engage in positive learning and improvement experiences, rather than downtrodden experiences, makes people feel both happier and supported in their role. 

Not to mention that as a leader, you can be more effective in your role when individuals feel they can share their mistakes openly and freely with everyone else. The reason is simple: the entire team can learn how to avoid making that mistake in future. By contrast, in environments where individuals are incentivised to cover their mistakes, from fear of retribution, then the wider team misses out on the learnings gained.

Agile values communication with customers highly. A team should be driven to do the things that build customer happiness, with the hope that they are delighted by the team's efforts. Since this is the case, teams that work in close collaboration with customers have the benefit of receiving that praise directly.  This praise, when received as part of a tight feedback loop with the customer, can be used as an early warning sign that something is not quite right when the amount of praise decreases.

Recognition has a half-life. One consideration of solely using annual reviews as an opportunity for recognition and praise is that these cultures risk leading to large dips in morale. As an alternative, spreading recognition throughout the year, with a platform for peer-to-peer recognition in place ensures there is never the opportunity for such dips. 

At Made Tech, we have "Made Merits", a form of Karma system that is used to reward good deeds on a peer-to-peer basis. A consideration of using such a platform is that it can lead to a dip in intrinsic motivation, this can be initially manifested by "will you give me a Merit if I do that," but also demotivation when a Merit isn't received. While we believe that "Made Merits" are a harmless part of our culture, it is possible to draw parallels between Merits and other extrinsic motivators.  

Recognise dependence on recognition, an extrinsic motivator, and ensuring they are also finding their work intrinsically rewarding is something that only the individual team member can do by themselves.
 

##Reward (Scott)
Having recognised and acknowledged the great work your team has done, it's time to talk about the ways in which teams and individuals can be rewarded. As we see it, rewards can be either extrinsic, something that either is or costs money, or intrinsic, something that lends itself to helping the people being rewarded feeling fulfilled and happy.

###Intrinsic
Arguably the more powerful type of reward is the intrinsic reward. It's also the trickier to give, since these rewards are _felt_, rather than simply received, and you can't force people to feel a certain way.

####Purpose
By making a point of monitoring and keeping morale up, along with creating communicative environments, allowing your team to structure the way they work, giving them ownership of delivery and many of the other practices we've discussed, the members of your team will feel a sense of purpose, a sense that they, and the work they're doing, _matters_.

With a sense of purpose, a team knows why what they're doing is important, they're driven to do it, and to do it well. Understanding how their work feeds into the wider company objectives plays a big part of instilling a sense of purpose, and we found it particularly useful to define a company mission in order to clarify why the company exists and what we're trying to achieve.

Each of our teams knows our company mission is to improve software delivery in every organisation, meaning every member of those teams believes in our mission, and anybody joining our team wants to help us achieve it.

####Self direction & organisation
- Allowing room to experiment in day to day work

####Freedom to learn
We're proud of the work we do with our customers, but every software engineer loves having the freedom to go off and get stuck into a technology that interests them, and the two things don't always align. Rather than snuffing that thirst for knowledge out, giving your team the space to pursue and share their interests is an excellent way to keep morale up, and may even yield benefits for the wider organisation down the line.

At Made Tech, the entire team often engages in a number of non customer focussed activities, such as code dojos and hack days, where we set aside an hour a week or an entire day every month or so for everyone to do something fun and interesting that doesn't necessarily have to have commercial benefits.
