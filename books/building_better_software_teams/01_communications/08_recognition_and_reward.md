#Recognition & Reward

##Why Recognition & Reward Is Important/Intro
- Keeping morale up

  Low morale is closely related to job satisfaction.  Not enough (or any) praise for a job well done, dealing with a difficult clients, or heavy
  workloads can significantly impact morale, to name but a few.

  Everyone within the organisation should always be concious of red flags such as a high rate of absenteeism, frequent conflict situations or dissatisfied clients.

  The root cause of this can be amplified for a number of complex reasons.
  Sometimes the reasons are personal to individuals which is harder to solve than work related low morale of a team.
  None the less, you should strive to understand the situation and help where possible.

  - Recognising low morale
  It is not difficult to recognise when a team has low morale. It is a situation that no organisation wants to be in as it has significant costs down
  the line.  Quality of the product suffers, clients are unhappy and there is no energy within the team.

  This can be a very serious issue that needs to be identified and addressed before it gets out of hand, usually resulting in people leaving the
  company.

  - Reasons morale drops
  There are various reasons for morale dropping within a company and below are some of the more common causes.

    - Poor leadership
    When no one steps up and accepts responsibility things can go very wrong.  There is avoidance of accountability and no one takes ownership, just passsing the buck to the next person.

    - Poor communication
    Everyone needs to be kept in the loop with what's going on in the current project.
    Goals, praise, performance or personal gripes will always arise and need to be communicated within the team.
    Team members also need to be upfront with each other.

    The last thing you want is a disengaged workforce where individuals feel left out and undesirable social hierarchies start to form.

      - Unresolved conflict situations

    Given the pressure in the software industry, conflict situations are sure to arise.
    The act of creating software for instance is a very subjective topic, and there are many confliting opinions on how to do it correctly.
    Fear of conflict will prevent certain individuals from bringing up topics that influence their morale.

    - Lack of empowerment or autonomy

    If you do not allow your team to take ownership of a feature, they will take less pride in it.  Here at Made we believe that programmers should be
    responsible for delivering features end to end.  This means dealing with all aspects of it from communication with clients to infrastructure to
    programming.  If you only deliver a very small slice of this, you will not appreciate the positive impact that you are having on the problem,
    which may lead to dissatisfaction.

    - Heavy workloads
    Bad estimates and poor planning can result in significant workloads on individuals.  No one wants to work overtime, especially if they are not
    being compensated for it. Failing to understand the underlying requirements of a piece of work can have drastic consequences on the amount of work
    that is required to be completed (See 80/20 rule).  There may be more sinister forces involved here like an understaffed workforce.

    - Poor working conditions
    Some companies fail to provide the very basic facilities required by employees to do their work.
    This will lead to frustration or even result in physical injury.

    - Difficult co workers
    Not everyone gets along.  If proper respect is not shown between

  - Tracking morale levels
  Frequent check ins (without micromanaging) could have a really positive effect on morale.

  - Setting expectations
  If your company has tried and tested techniques for doing business, they should be documented and made freely available amongst your employees.

    - Employee handbook
    Here at Made we have an ever growing Employee Handbook.  If you have questions about process related topics, you can probably find it there.

    If you cannot find it, you can issue a pull request to get it added.  This will also help boot up a constructive conversation about the topic at
    hand.

##Recognition (Craig)

A downside of only having individual recognition is that it can introduce competition. To receive recognition, you must excel compared to your colleagues. Unfortunately, this can lead to unhealthy environments and slow degradation of teamwork.

By contrast, cultures with only full team recognition lead to a marked increase in amounts of cooperation and collaboration, as this is the only way to achieve success.  The downside of team-only recognition is that it can go awry when individuals begin to feel that underperformers are receiving just as much reward for their actions.

Another solution seen in other cultures is never to recognise anyone for fear of causing these problems. It is important to consider that this will begin to cause individuals to feel unvalued.

Although we value individual recognition, we favour team recognition. We also believe that people should be recognised primarily through ad-hoc channels, by their peers, not by whoever sits above them in the hierarchy. We use continuous feedback as a platform for this recognition.

It's important to recognise the highly positive impact that recognising teams and individuals has on morale. Also, and potentially more importantly, the disturbing implications of poorly handling mistakes as well.

In a high safety, high trust environment, with practices such as continuous feedback and retrospectives, the detection of a mistake should not be seen as an opportunity for a chastising or otherwise attacking the individual(s) responsible for that mistake.

Morale can be boosted during periods of adversity too, through robust, mature methods for picking up the pieces after a mistake has made. Using mistakes as opportunities to engage in positive learning and improvement experiences, rather than downtrodden experiences, makes people feel both happier and supported in their role.

Not to mention that as a leader, you can be more effective in your role when individuals feel they can share their mistakes openly and freely with everyone else. The reason is simple: the entire team can learn how to avoid making that mistake in future. By contrast, in environments where individuals are incentivised to cover their mistakes, from fear of retribution, then the wider team misses out on the learnings gained.

Agile values communication with customers highly. A team should be driven to do the things that build customer happiness, with the hope that they are delighted by the team's efforts. Since this is the case, teams that work in close collaboration with customers have the benefit of receiving that praise directly.  This praise, when received as part of a tight feedback loop with the customer, can be used as an early warning sign that something is not quite right when the amount of praise decreases.

Recognition has a half-life. One consideration of solely using annual reviews as an opportunity for recognition and praise is that these cultures risk leading to large dips in morale. As an alternative, spreading recognition throughout the year, with a platform for peer-to-peer recognition in place ensures there is never the opportunity for such dips.

At Made Tech, we have "Made Merits", a form of Karma system that is used to reward good deeds on a peer-to-peer basis. A consideration of using such a platform is that it can lead to a dip in intrinsic motivation, this can be initially manifested by "will you give me a Merit if I do that," but also demotivation when a Merit isn't received. While we believe that "Made Merits" are a harmless part of our culture, it is possible to draw parallels between Merits and other extrinsic motivators.

Recognise dependence on recognition, an extrinsic motivator, and ensuring they are also finding their work intrinsically rewarding is something that only the individual team member can do by themselves.


##Reward (Scott)
Having recognised and acknowledged the great work your team has done, it's time to talk about the ways in which teams and individuals can be rewarded. As we see it, rewards can be either extrinsic, something that either is or costs money, or intrinsic, something that lends itself to helping the people being rewarded feeling fulfilled and happy.

###Intrinsic
Arguably the more powerful type of reward is the intrinsic reward. It's also the trickier to give, since these rewards are something teams need to _feel_, rather than be given, and you can't force people to feel a certain way.

####Purpose
By making a point of monitoring and keeping morale up, along with creating communicative environments where their hard work can be recognised, allowing your team to structure the way they work, giving them ownership of delivery and many of the other practices we've discussed, the members of your team will feel a sense of purpose, a sense that they, and the work they're doing, _matters_.

With a sense of purpose, a team knows why what they're doing is important, they're driven to do it, and to do it well. Understanding how their work feeds into the wider company objectives plays a big part of instilling a sense of purpose, and we found it particularly useful to define a company mission in order to clarify why the company exists and what we're trying to achieve.

Each of our teams knows our company mission is to improve software delivery in every organisation, meaning every member of those teams believes in our mission, and anybody joining our team wants to help us achieve it.

####Freedom to learn
We're proud of the work we do with our customers, but every software engineer loves having the freedom to go off and get stuck into a technology that interests them, and the two things don't always align. Rather than snuffing that thirst for knowledge out, giving your team the space to pursue and share their interests is an excellent way to keep morale up, and may even yield benefits for the wider organisation down the line.

At Made Tech, the entire team often engages in a number of non customer focussed activities, such as code dojos and hack days, where we set aside an hour a week or an entire day every month or so for everyone to do something fun and interesting that doesn't necessarily have to have commercial benefits.

This creates an environment where every member of the team knows they have the freedom to suggest other ways in which to promote learning, and that their team will respond positively to their suggestions. A recent example is the "Code Roast", a variation on the traditional practice of code reviews, whereby a team member will pull out a piece of code they're particularly not proud of, present it to the rest of the team and then spend an hour pointing out its flaws, and then working together to improve it.

####Fresh challenges
For organisations like ours, who work on a variety of different projects for different customers, having a team stay on one project for months on end can become tiresome, leading to a loss of productivity and enthusiasm. While it's beneficial to have somebody on the project throughout the engagement, if only to help build and maintain a relationship with the customer, we've found it important to let our teams know that, if they have a burning desire to do so, they have the opportunity to change things up at semi-regular intervals throughout the year.

A team member can choose to either stick, and stay on the project they're on, or twist, so that they can pursue a fresh challenge. Knowing that you're not shackled to a particular project for what could be years is liberating, and keeps things feeling fresh.

###Extrinsic
On the other side of the coin are extrinsic rewards. These are things the company can give to teams to both celebrate their work, and also to maintain a healthy level of morale. While we're not advocating showering them with gifts, we do see benefits to treating your team beyond just material gains.

What follows is a list of extrinsic rewards we've handed out, but we would advise that the list is neither exhaustive nor necessarily the best fit for every organisation.

####Company Retreat
After a particularly successful year, the entire Made Tech team was rewarded for their efforts with a company retreat. This took the shape of a 5 day break in Spain, where we'd spend a few hours each day building a product we'd use internally, and then hanging out in the evenings. This could be seen as both an extrinisic and intrinsic reward, as everything was paid for by the company, but we used the building of the project as another opportunity to learn, and the entire experience was a great team building activity.
