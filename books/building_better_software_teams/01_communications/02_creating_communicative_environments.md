# Creating Environments That Promote Communication

## Introduction
In any organisation, one of the most powerful ways you can empower your team is to give them an environment that allows them to communicate freely at all levels. At Made Tech, we frequently use the phrase "flat heirarchy" to describe our working environment, and it means we actively encourage every member of the team to initiate or join any discussion that interests them, whether it be giving their opinion on how a part of the business runs, or introducing a new way of approaching how we work.

As a result, we've had valuable contributions from the entire team that have gone on to improve the way we work, build camaraderie and keep everyone up to speed on the goings on across the entire business.

## The benefits of good communication

### Visibility
As organisations grow, it's often easy for, as the saying goes, the left hand to have no idea what the right hand is doing. Project teams may not be aware of what each other is working on, it may not be clear to the wider team what pieces of work management are trying to win, and it's especially difficult for peers to know who is trying to develop a particular skill they might be able to help with.

As well as that, such a lack of visibility allows silos to develop naturally, where one or more developers wall themselves off to outside interference in order to concentrate on work. Whilst this is not a bad trait in moderation, left unchecked it can lead to those individual developers having exclusive domain knowledge, which then leads to bigger problems if there's a problem with the project they've been working on and they're unavailable for any reason.

By increasing visibility, via the methods described later in this article, teams gain a shared understanding of the direction the company is headed in, who's working on what, and individual projects. Team members are also actively able to help each other grow, which ultimately benefits the entire company.

### Team cohesion

A good company culture is important, and so giving your team ways to flex their tech muscles outside of obligations to customers is a great way to promote that. Whether it's an hour tackling [a small, fun coding challenge][dojos], an entire day learning about a new technology, or a few days away on a company retreat, the time spent will go a long way to both ensuring your team are getting exposure to technologies and practices that interest and excite them, and that they're becoming a stronger and more collaborative team for it.

## Open channels
### Continuous feedback

Chris has written about Continuous Feedback and its benefits at length [here][cf], but in a nutshell: Continuous Feedback is the practice we use to encourage and address regular feedback from everyone _about_ everyone. We found that annual reviews fell short in helping individuals learn and grow, and switching over to Continuous Feedback has allowed us to get a better sense of the goals people are trying to reach, and the areas in which they need improvement. Importantly, it also allows us to act quickly to help them reach those goals, and give them the support they need in the areas in which they need improving.

### TGIFs

One of the problems we were having was that it often wasn't clear what other people outside of your team was working on week to week. They may have been on a new project, running with a new initiative, or on a recruiting drive. Our solution to this problem is what we've lovingly dubbed "TGIFs".

A TGIF is simply an email sent at the end of every Friday, with a short breakdown of what each of the various teams and departments within the company have achieved that week. Each team sends their breakdown to one person, and that person collates them all and sends out the email.

TGIFs are a great way of giving your entire team visibility on what's happening within the company, and also reminding people of important events coming up the following week.

### Comradrospectives

Retrospectives are a key component of the Agile process, occuring at the end of a period of work and allowing teams to reflect on what went well, what didn't go so well, and what they can learn from that.

We've reappropriated that idea and applied it to the entire company, so that the entire team gathers together every few weeks to discuss our biggest sources of frustration, share our achivements, and figure out what we need to focus on in order to continue to improve the experience we provide to our customers, and the way we work.

Prior to each comradrospective, each team and department have a brief retrospective, and then bring the notes from that to the larger meeting. A Facilitator hosts the comradrospective, going around the room and prompting discussions about what each team found in their retrospectives. The Facilitator then looks for common threads between those discussions, which often leads to the highlighting of a wider company issue that can be focussed on over the next few weeks.

It should be noted that the role of Facilitator doesn't belong to one person, we actively encourage everyone on the team to take up the mantle for two reasons:

- Each person will approach the role differently, ensuring comradrospectives never feel old.
- It gives everyone a little bit of exposure to standing up in front of people and leading the conversation, which is valuable experience to have when your team is expected to present things like [showcases to clients][showcases].

## Knowledge sharing

### Presentations



### Rotating teams (sharing domain knowledge)

### Hack days

## Extreme programming
- Pair programming
- Planning game
- "Whole team" (this is about having the PO be part of the workflow)

## "Flat Heirarchy"
- Everyone is approachable
- Making sure everyone has a voice (extroverts vs. introverts)

## Regular standups
- Scrum of scrums

## Challenges in maintaining good communication
- Apathy
- Tendency to slip headphones on and shut everyone else out
  - appropriate in some cases, but not always
- Too many cooks / endless debates
