#Retrospectives

## What is a retrospective

At the end of an iteration it's good to take some time to reflect as a team; to assess what worked, what didn't work, and what could be improved upon. This can result in future iterations being more effiecient and productive, as well as increasing happiness in the team.

At the most basic level, a retrospective can just be the team sitting together and putting different items under headings. It allows everyone to feedback from their perspective, providing increased insight throughout the team. They can then vote as to which things the team views as highest priority and create action points for future iterations around these. Keeping this to a small list is most prudent as it won't overload the team and any recurring themes should show up in future retrospectives if they weren't decided as action points this time around.

Retrospectives that have resulted in action points that led to big improvements within a team should be shared back to the organisation as a whole, so that other teams can potentially benefit from learnings.

## The Prime Directive

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand - _[Norm Kerth](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html)_

It's vital that a retrospective is run in a way where all members feel safe to discuss their viewpoints. Describing something that went wrong should always be seperated from an individual so that they don't feel attacked. If someone feels unsafe they're unlikely to be able to fully engage with the retrospective. Violations of The Prime Directive, delibarate or otherwise, should be seem as a team smell, and may lead to the team going into the next iteration with a negative mindset.

Some steps you can take to help maintain safety such as reading out The Prime Directive before a retro, having facilitators, conducting safety/pressure checks which we'll cover later.

##Safety checks

Before starting a retro we'd recommend you run a safety check. The facilitator should ask each team member to write a number between 0 and 5 on a post-it or similar, the meaning of these numbers is shown below:

5 - I’ll talk about anything
4 - I’ll talk about almost anything; a few things might be hard
3 - I’ll talk about some things, but others will be hard to say
2 - I’m not going to say much, I’ll let others bring up issues
1 - I’ll smile, claim everything is great and agree with authority figures
0 - I'm not comfortable talking/I don't want to do this/I want to leave

Once these have been anonymously collected, the facilitator should tally the count. If there are more low numbers than high they should ask if the team would like the retrospective to continue. Either way there should be a brief discussion as to why the team thinks the numbers are low if people want to engage with that. If it's decided that the retrospective shouldn't run, then a small exercise on trying to figure out reasons for the safety of the team being low should be done.

It follows the basic flow:

 * Facilitator asks everyone to put themselves in the shoes of someone who might not feel safe and to note down what those causes might be
 * Based on the submitted post-it notes, add a separate column where people can think of reasons that might cause these issues
 * Based on the potential causes, add another column asking for people to submit potential solutions
 * Read these all out and discuss with the team
 * Run the safety check again

If the safety level has increased after this point, then you can run the retrospective.

## Facilitators

An important role in a retrospective is that of the Facilitator. They have important tasks to do, while also contributing in feedback too:

 * Outlines the exercise to the team and explains how it should work
 * Keeps the exercise on track, with a balance of strict time keeping while trying to keep the atmosphere relaxed and informal in vibes
 * Ensures the Prime Directive is adhered to
 * If the team is struggling, helping and prompting thoughts and ideas
 * Follows up after a retrospective with the action points being circulated around the team
 * Try to ensure everyone on the team contributes to the discussion

The facilitator is responsible for coming up with the exercise the retrospective will use. We'll discuss some different ideas below, but there are numerous websites out there that provide ready made ones that are simple to follow.

To keep retrospectives fresh and different, it's important to rotate the responsibility between all team members each session that's held.

## Scheduling and frequency

We derive the most value from retros when we run at the end of each iteration (for us weekly), directly after a Showcase. By running them before the next iteration begins the team is able to take the learnings and outcomes directly into the following week.

If for whatever reason the team is unable to run one we've found it best to wait until the next scheduled retrospective, so as to not disrupt the current iteration. Ideally these shouldn't be missed barring illness or holidays. If a team member has contributions to make but can't attend they can choose to provide these to the facilitator ahead of time.

## Exercises

To keep energy up in a retrospective and help provide focus to the areas the team aims to cover it's common to use exercises.

Some exercises that we've found useful, and you could try:

### The Happiness Graph

Ask each team member to draw a graph of how happy they were over the duration of the sprint. Once everyone has finished, move around the table asking people to go into a bit more detail of the high and low spikes. Write a post-it note for each of these, adding them to a board. 

Using these post-it notes, you can come up with ideas to continue doing for future sprints, as for the ones that didn't go so well, try and come up with ideas on how to improve them for next time.

This provides a chance to measure team sentiment while conducting the retrospective.

### Hot air balloon

The hot air balloon exercise is popular in our office, it works as follows;

1. Draw a hot air balloon on a whiteboard or other canvas.
2. The facilitator should provide a prompt like 'Looking back, what was our hot air, taking us higher, and what were our sand bags, bringing us down?'
	* They should then right these down above and below the balloon as appropriate.
	* The team discusses each point as they go to make sure there is a shared understanding.
3. The facilitor then can offer another prompt 'Looking ahead; what stormy weather can we see making the route to our goal difficult, and what steps can we take to move towards sunny days and an easier path?'
	* These suggestions are again mapped to their appropriate area on the drawing, and discussed among the team.

By approaching the retro in this way we can not both reflect on the previous iteration, and look ahead and spot potential pitfalls and ways to avoid them.

You may notice that both of these exercises follow the same outline as the basic one provided at the start. Most exercises serve as wrappers to the core idea of;

1. What went badly?
2. What went well?
3. How can we improve going forward?

Mixing these exercises up is an ideal way to keep things fresh and provide different perspectives and prompts to these questions, and also make it feel like it's not always the same thing everytime
