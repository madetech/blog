# Giving teams freedom to structure their own time


## Communicating with clients directly

Before a team is about to start development, having introductions with the client will prove highly beneficial during the development period.

Traditional approaches have been for there to be project manager to act as the go between from developers to clients and vice versa. This has always added extra time into a project - usually time spent waiting on responses. This can lead to stop-start interruptions which normally result in developers downing tools, and starting other work to fill the gaps. 

What harm is there in empowering the team to communicate directly with the client and enhance the relationship? 

[@todo something about technical speak, and reigning that in]

For starters it'll save a bunch of time. When a developer is unsure of something, rather than risking development time that will potentially need to be backtracked later, give the client a call or IM them to get faster feedback or clarification around the work. It's essential that the team and client can create a fast feedback cycle to reduce the potential for interruptions to the development process.

It's important that clients understand the process, which will be discussed in the next point.

Developers will better understand client priorities if they're communicating directly, rather than being shielded unnecessarily from them. It helps that a team is conscious of these, so that they can make decisions that add better business value for the client. 

Through identifying the clients priorities, and the constant communication, the team is well placed to shape the work for each iteration without outside guidance.

## Establishing work process

Early on in building the engagement with the client, the intended work process should be discussed and explained to the client so that they'll be on the same page as the developers when they're introduced. Clients need to be sold on the advantages of devolving management to the team while also knowing they can reach out to others in the business if they need to.

One of the main advantages gained through this process is the ability for the team and client to plan short iterations that allow for showcases of the work throughout development. The team should be able to identify the priority for each iteration through this close relationship with the client and be able to depend on the client throughout iterations to provide feedback and guidance around any ambiguous areas.

On longer running engagements this should mean the stakeholder on the client side participates in the team's standup and is available via the communication formats outlined above throughout the day. It's important that developers can contact them quickly with any queries or concerns. This also helps foster a closer relationship between the client and the business.

It's important that showcases are run by the development team, extra points for rotating chair duties, and that they focus on the work that was defined as being part of the iteration following the last showcase. Any feedback that comes from this showcase should be part of the next iteration rather than being added to a backlog where possible. If feedback is left open you run the risk of it getting lost, the client feeling ignored, or the original issue becoming unusable and not providing any value to the client.

## Establishing the business process

Clients are onboard with this new way of working. But is the team? Do they really have the freedom to do all they need to self-organise? Do they feel trusted?

We have a [handbook](https://github.com/madetech/handbook) that the entire world can see - it's important to have this process documented so that it's repeatable and transparent.

The handbook outlines how the business expects individuals to organise things like holidays and remote work (to be discussed later on in more detail) so that the team can effectively shape their workload.

By making holidays and remote work visible to everyone via shared calendars, these decisions can be easily made by the team, these also allow the individual to make a quick judgement call on the viability of a request.

For example while we might let everyone know we want to take a week off or work from home, we only require our team mates to ok it.

## Let team members communicate with one another

It's equally important for team members to be able to communicate amongst themselves without barriers.

Where a team member is shouldn't increase friction in communicating with the rest of the team. Our office is spread over three floors, and people are often spread out over the entirety of it and others are working remotely. Team communication needs to work for all of these scenarios. This is where tooling is very important for it to be a success.

Day-to-day the team need to be able to attend standup no matter where they are. Them being out of the office shouldn't be a barrier to participation. After all, a client is going to call into these, so the team needs to too. Test out the various tools to see what works best for your team and clients and use this wherever possible.

## Remote work

When working remotely it's key that team mates and the clients are unaffected, the individual assumes the responsibility or maintaining the everyday standard these people are accustomed to. This means both the quality of work and the actual process, you don't want to be calling your client from a noisy place where the communication will suffer.

We feel we've got the correct toolset to allow for the entire company to be remote on a given day. Recently we had to contend with constant construction noise next to the office and all worked elsewhere for a day or two with no impact to the clients, workload or our day-to-day process. One of the things we do to increase people's presence when out of the office is to drop a quick message into our chat when we're going to be away for a period of time like at lunch.

## Holidays

Beyond what we've outlined above the main thing with holidays is ensuring that someone is still available to maintain momentum.

Some examples of things to self-organise:

 * Workload
    https://www.madetech.com/blog/let-your-teams-plan-for-themselves
    Ask forgiveness, not permission - https://www.madetech.com/blog/how-to-build-an-agile-team
 * Remote work
 * Holidays
 * Hackdays & Dojos

1. Let teams communicate with clients directly (self define work, being introduced to team)
3. Establishing work process (small iterations, standups, showcases, make sure client is available during iterations - to be able to get the fast feedback)
4. Establishing business process (handbook, calendars, visibility)
2. Let team members communicate with one another (remote/in office)
5. Remote work (scheduling/notice for team/communication tools)
6. Hackdays/Dojos (business value in learning new things/letting clients know off project)
8. Holidays (checking with the team/making sure the whole team aren't off at the same time/enough cover)
7. Knowledge sharing (good that everyone on the team has as much of the same knowledge as possible/pairing/potential working on site with clients for better understanding, gaining knowledge faster from people who use stuff day to day)
10. Testing/phrasing in the culture of self organising teams
9. 'Management' involvement (not being afraid to step in/or assist/ask for forgiveness not permission/clients aware of how we work)

Common things:

 * Communication directly with clients (instant messaging is key, if not essential)
 * Communication with team

For some of the above topics, remote work and holiday for example are documented in our handbook - in terms of process to follow.

Important for the team to know what work is coming up, what goals need to be met.

Making decisions on the above things as a team.

'People above' not to be afraid to step in and course correct if needed. In a non-heavy handed manner.

Comparisons with a non team-led organisation. Top down approach.
Potential bottlenecks.

Knowledge sharing vital.
Pre-holiday handovers.
Visibility over time. Calendars, Trello. Don't lock down this to specific people. Open for all.

Self-organising holidays was trialled. Don't be afraid to try things out. Agile.
Don't be against something until you've tried it.

Lots of business are against remote work, as they're worried they can't 'see' people working.

Know your toolset!

Workload; re showcases, we clear next iteration plans with them, so we know quickly if things are heading off course. Regular and quick feedback from clients is a good thing.

Ensuring clients are on the same page as us re this approach. So there's no surprises when work commences. Usually explained at sales stage/pitch.

Ensuring clients are available regularly for showcases/standups.

Standups aid a lot with self organising teams as course corrections can be made quickly.

All hands - start, mid and end of week standups so company is in the loop with what is going on. Focus is on goals rather than a standard stand up.
