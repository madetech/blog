# Empowerment

In this section, we look at a number of techniques that you can employ to increase the levels of empowerment in your team.

Teams with higher levels of empowerment often show increased levels of satisfaction, and subsequently deliver higher performance. Allowing people the freedom to structure their workload and workday can be a great first step to empowerment.

From here, exploring a workflow whereby you express higher level problems or goals to the team, and then have the team themselves work to identify the solutions, and the best way to implement and deliver them.

With empowerment, it's also important to balance accountability. An empowered team who are tasked with solving higher level problems also need to have an appropriate level of accountability for delivering these solutions.

As an added bonus to great empowerment, more empowered and autonomous delivery teams can reduce reliance on the management tier of the organisation, allowing a greater ability to scale engineering efforts.
