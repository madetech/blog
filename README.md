# Made Tech Blog

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers.

One of ours aims is to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning, and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers, especially those who fall into the various [customer personas](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing) we would like to target.

#### Marketing
When a post is published, Scott will market on the following channels:

- Twitter, several times
- LinkedIn
- HackerNews
- DZone
- RubyFlow (if relevant)
- Sitepoint (if relevant)
- Tech London Slack (if appropriate)
- The newsletter

You're encouraged to share and market your own posts in any way you see fit but, in the spirit of fair play, please share any marketing advice not mentioned here with the rest of the team, or add it to this readme.

#### Prize

**The winning team can take an Uber from the office to celebrate their victory with dinner and cocktails at a restaurant of their choice (Seb heartily recommends [this one](http://www.bobbobricard.com/), which has a champagne button). Plus ones also welcome.**

#### Meeting deadlines

It can be difficult to find time to write a post - to make it a little easier, you're able to take one hour each week to blog, whenever you see fit (we call it #blogHour). Just announce that you're taking it in Slack.

Teams are encouraged to self organise, if you're struggling to get a post written on time, communicate with your team mates to figure out how best to meet your various deadlines. It's also up to you to decide when to go for your victory dinner!

Deadlines are listed here: https://trello.com/b/jDROwI93/editorial-calendar/calendar/2016/03

Finally, every six weeks, the entire company will meet for a blogging showcase, where everyone will announce their next post, and we'll discuss what worked and what didn't work in the previous six weeks worth of posts.

## How to blog

Once you've settled on an idea, clone this repo and write a blog post on a topic of your choosing. When you're finished, create a pull request and get it reviewed. You should be aiming to have this first draft completed a week before your deadline, to give your colleagues the time to review it for you.

Resolve any issues that have been raised in the review (poke and nag other people to make comments on your post in good time), and update your pull request.

### Checklist

### Popular traffic sources

Historically, sharing a link to a post on sites like RubyFlow has resulted in a huge spike in traffic on our site. Below is a list of popular traffic sources we should be sharing those links on. It's by no means exhaustive, and not all of them are relevant to every type of post, so do share the link anywhere else that may be appropriate.

We used to share them on Reddit, but they frown upon posting your own links so we don't do that any more.
