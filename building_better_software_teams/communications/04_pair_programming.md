# Pair Programming
Pair programming is the practice of having two developers sit at one computer, with one driving, and the other navigating. The driver types out the code, whilst the navigator constantly reviews what is being typed and, at regular intervals, the developers switch roles.

We've helped a number of organisations successfully adopt pair programming, giving their teams the ability to increase productivity, improve knowledge sharing and enhance the quality of their software.

With this article/chapter, we're sharing our experiences when introducing pair programming to software teams, and we'll take you through the techniques you'll need to apply what we've learnt to your organisation.

### Background
Pair programming was first introduced as part of the Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology, as an 'extreme' way to practice regular code reviews. Conceived of by [Kent Beck in 1999](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416), XP is a collection of software principles which help teams to deliver higher quality software. It places value on communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect, all of which, as you'll discover, lead to a positive pair programming experience. 

### How It Works
There are a few rules that you should follow when pair progamming. These will help you to get the most out of your pair programming experience and not fall into the traps that others have experienced before you. 

-- Driving
The driver is solely responsible for typing and controlling the screen. They should externalise their thoughts as they type, and be sure to constantly communicate with their navigator, discussing ideas and clarifying where necessary.

-- Navigating
The navigator is responsible for reviewing everything the driver types, suggesting improvements to the code being written, alternate ways to think about the problem at hand, and pointing out typos when it is safe to do so.

-- Switching
After a short period of time, to be agreed upon by the developers, the pair should switch roles to allow each person to get an equal amount of time driving and navigating.

-- Taking Breaks
Pair programming is intensive, so pairs must make time for short breaks roughly every hour.

-- Coaching vs. Pairing
Pair programming is when peers sit and work together, but it's not uncommon to see pair programming as a form of coaching, where a more experienced developer will sit with a less experienced developer and attempt to upskill and explain their rationale around particular design solutions.

### Why It Works

-- Increase Brainpower
-- Validation Of Ideas

### Benefits Of Pairing
-- Productivity & Focus
-- Higher Quality

-- Learning
-- Continuous Code Review

### Challenges In Pairing
-- Switching Mindsets
-- People & Time
-- Exhaustion
-- Disengagement
-- Skill Disparity
-- Bad Pairs
-- Backseat Driving
-- Communication (Your Baby Is Ugly)
