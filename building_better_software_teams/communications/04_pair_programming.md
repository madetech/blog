# Pair Programming
Pair programming is the practice of having two developers sit at one computer, with one driving, and the other navigating. The driver types out the code, whilst the navigator constantly reviews what is being typed and, at regular intervals, the developers switch roles.

We've helped a number of organisations successfully adopt pair programming, giving their teams the ability to increase productivity, improve knowledge sharing and enhance the quality of their software.

With this article/chapter, we're sharing our experiences when introducing pair programming to software teams, and we'll take you through the techniques you'll need to apply what we've learnt to your organisation.

### Background
Pair programming was first introduced by the Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology as an 'Extreme' way to practice regular code reviews. 

### How It Works
-- Driving
-- Navigating
-- Switching
-- Taking Breaks
-- Coaching vs. Pairing
    - When pair programming, you'll either be peers of a similar skill level who can pick up after one another as though they were handing the baton over in a relay race, or a teacher/student combo where the focus is on educating the student on the job.

### Why It Works

-- People & Time
-- Exhaustion
-- Disengagement
-- Skill Disparity
-- Bad Pairs
