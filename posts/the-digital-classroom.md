# The Digital Classroom

From keeping in touch with friends, to hailing a cab, and even allowing us to control the temperature of our houses from our phones, Technology has become increasingly pervasive, changing the way we do things and how we interact with one another. Contrary to what some would think, Education was not left out of this revolution. In recent years, an incredible number of digital tools and platforms have seen the light of day which try to improve how people learn, how teachers share their knowledge and allowing pedagogical resource provider to reach an ever increasing number of people. But in Education, things cannot change as rapidly as in other sectors because the cost of doing something wrong has long lasting consequences. Pedagogical practices have been refined over the years and introducing changes requires a lot of thought.

In this post, we would like to first look at some areas where Technology could actually add value to existing practices, and how it can be used to solve particular pain points. Then we will move on to sometimes unforeseen challenges schools and universities face when going digital. Finally we will provide some thoughts on how to ensure the digital transition is as smooth and as successful as possible.
