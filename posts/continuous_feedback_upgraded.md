# Continuous Feedback

## Introduction

- Something like the major of NY story
- As developers we favour short feedback cycles in all things

## What's wrong with more traditional methods

- too far apart/long feedback cycles

More traditional peformance review cycles are generally spaced between 6 and 12 months apart. This is too long. It's rare that providing feedback today on something that happened more than half a year ago could be considered timely, valuable, or actionable.

Feedback given over such long cycles will always have a strong bias to more recent events. It's particularly easy to mis-remember details of events that occured more than a couple of weeks ago, which is compounded for large teams.

- often just used as a salary renegotiation without real focus on improvement

Employees and Managers often head in to performance reviews with different purposes. Managers are most interested in discussing performance improvements, whereas the employee may be more focused on their payrise.

- all feedback is delivered through the lens of your line manager

The most valuable feedback is likely to come from those who work most closely with the individual, which more often is the persons peers rather than their Line Manager.

- doesn't foster an environment of regular improvement, people just try harder close to review season

With a bias towards recent events, it's natural for employees to try hard in the run up to review season - often showing a flurry of activity towards last reviews goals in the couple of weeks prior to review. It's hard to give objective feedback at the end of the year if an employees performance peaks and troughs in this manner.

Additionally, infrequent review points don't encourage a healthy culture of year-round introspection and self-improvement.

- really time consuming during 'review season'

Most Line Managers dread review season as it's often a huge amount of work to collate feedback for all their reports for the whole of the past year. It's hard given this workload to stay objective, and give equal weight to all of their direct reports and instead focus on their favourites.

## Introducing an alternative

- Favour small feedback cycles of actionable feedback

Modern software delivery practices encourage us to value short feedback loops, right from cutting code to shipping software in to the hands of customers. We'd encourage taking a similar approach to personal development - fostering a culture where feedback is timely, relevant and actionable.

- Ensure employees receive feedback from peers as well as managers

The most valuable feedback you're likely to receive is from those you work most closely with. In many organisations this is likely to be peers rather than a manager. People performing a similar job are likely to view the world through a similar lens so are able to provide feedback in a more relevant context.

- Foster an environment of continuous feedback and improvement

Feedback shouldn't be seen as a task to be done, but as a means to achieve a constant cycle of intospection and improvement. Such a culture shift wouldn't be possible with a bi-annual or annual review program. Encouraging people to self-reflect is useful for building humility in a team, as only a team that is cogniscent of its weaknesses is able to truly excel.

## How to adopt Continuous Feedback

- Start with a small group

Like most initiatives, it's best to start with a small pilot program, onboarding a few people a week to the new way of doing things rather than trying to change everybody at once.

- Coach how to give feedback effectively

Giving good feedback is hard especially if people aren't used to doing so. The expectation of a CF initiative is that everyone will be giving much more feedback so consider providing coaching or guidance on how to make feedback delivered as useful as possible.


- Use a model such as SAID to structure feedback

Delivering good feedback is half of the battle so we use something called the SAID model to ensure good, actionable feedback. The SAID model provides a simple way to give effective, positive, and constructive feedback:
 * Specifics: State what has or has not been done using concrete examples
 * Ask: Ask open ended questions to understand their perspective ("How do you see the situation?" "Did I contribute to the problem in some way?")
 * Impact: Express the impact on the team or the business.
 * Do: State what action should be taken

- Provide a structure for providing feedback (trello)
With employees receiving feedback regularly, you'll need to provide a lightweight tool for employees to provide feedback to each other - trying to keep things as transparent as possible will also help foster an environment of openness. We use a Trello board for every to provide feedback on anyone they've worked with recently.

- Provide a structure for capturing and discussing feedback (spreadsheet)
As well as tooling for capturing feedback it's important to also provide people with a mechanism for:

* Recording feedback received
* Discussing its impact
* Agreeing actions
* and reviewing previous actions

It's easy to lose sight of longer term goals when receiving such regular, specific feedback. Consider providing people with a means to document their longer term goals and record the feedback against them.

- review feedback regularly with different people (1-to-1s)

Each person should have a weekly or bi-weekly session with a peer or manager to discuss their feedback. Using the tooling previously described to provide structure to the session, each piece of feedback should be discussed, with the role of the peer to provide another perspective and a layer of objectivity.

The goal of the session is to leave with 2 or 3 clear and achievable goals to bring to the next review. It's important to be able to come to the next session with a sense of completion, so be wary of taking on many, or unachievable goals.

- Keep up the momentum, reward buy-in

As with any new initiative, ongoing effort is needed to keep up momentum. Your organisational culture may dictate the best way to achieve this, though there are a number of techniques we've used in the past to varying degrees of success:
 * Small regular rewards/prizes for best piece feedback given
 * Encourage people to swap peers for each 1 to 1 session
 * Changing around the format from time to time
 * Choosing different theme/providing specific questions to ask when reviewing feedback
 * Regularly collecting feedback on the process itself to try to keep it valuable
 * Encourage buy in from the senior management team and have them solicit candid feedback from their reports. This is a good way for a culture of continuous feedback to 'trickle down' big corporate hierarcies

## Common arguments against adopting CF and their counter-arguments.
- We need to capture performance data in an employeeâ€™s profile for future promotion and other talent reviews, development plans, and career progression

Continuous feedback doesn't remove this, but it does shift the ownership of much of this data into the hands of the employee. If anything continuous feedback, done well, provides a more complete picture of performance for informing things such as salary reviews.

- We need a record of low performance when we let someone go



- We need a way to make sure managers are doing their jobs well
- We need something for HR to do (no we dont)

## Our observations

- More employees buy into it than others
- Has a tendency to stagnate if format remains constant
- Poor forum for dealing with larger issues
- Without monitoring its easy for people to duck under the radar
- Struggle to keep accountability around short term goals
- Forces employees to carve out their own career path, which not everyuone is comfortable doing

## Key takeaways

- if you want to build high performing teams delivering feedback as often as possible is crucial
- not necessarily the right forum for renegotiating salaries, but can augment the existing Annual review format and provide much more concrete data from accross the year
- Separate the discussions about performance from discussions about potential and future career plans
