# Continuous Feedback

## Introduction

- Something like the major of NY story
- As developers we favour short feedback cycles in all things

## What's wrong with more traditional methods

- too far apart/long feedback cycles

More traditional peformance review cycles are generally spaced between 6 and 12 months apart. This is too long. It's rare that providing feedback today on something that happened more than half a year ago could be considered timely, valuable, or actionable.

Feedback given over such long cycles will always have a strong bias to more recent events. It's particularly easy to mis-remember details of events that occured more than a couple of weeks ago, which is compounded for large teams.

- often just used as a salary renegotiation without real focus on improvement

Employees and Managers often head in to performance reviews with different purposes. Managers are most interested in discussing performance improvements, whereas the employee may be more focused on their payrise.

- all feedback is delivered through the lens of your line manager

The most valuable feedback is likely to come from those who work most closely with the individual, which more often is the persons peers rather than their Line Manager.

- doesn't foster an environment of regular improvement, people just try harder close to review season

With a bias towards recent events, it's natural for employees to try hard in the run up to review season - often showing a flurry of activity towards last reviews goals in the couple of weeks prior to review. It's hard to give objective feedback at the end of the year if an employees performance peaks and troughs in this manner.

Additionally, infrequent review points don't encourage a healthy culture of year-round introspection and self-improvement.

- really time consuming during 'review season'

Most Line Managers dread review season as it's often a huge amount of work to collate feedback for all their reports for the whole of the past year. It's hard given this workload to stay objective, and give equal weight to all of their direct reports and instead focus on their favourites.

- Managers cannot typically “judge” an entire year of work from an individual at one time

##? Introducing an alternative

- Favour small feedback cycles of actionable feedback
- Ensure employees receive feedback from peers as well as managers
- Foster an environment of continuous feedback and improvement

## How to adopt Continuous Feedback

- Start with a small group

Like most initiatives, it's best to start with a small pilot program, onboarding a few people a week to the new way of doing things rather than trying to change everybody at once.

- Coach how to give feedback effectively

Giving good feedback is hard especially if people aren't used to doing so. The expectation of a CF initiative is that everyone will be giving much more feedback so consider providing coaching or guidance on how to make feedback delivered as useful as possible.

- Provide a structure for providing feedback

With employees receiving feedback regularly, you'll need to provide a lightweight tool for employees to provide feedback to each other - trying to keep things as transparent as possible will also help foster an environment of openness. We use a Trello board for every to provide feedback on anyone they've worked with recently.

- Provide a structure for capturing and discussing feedback
- Build-in actionable somethings

It's important to prompt employees to process fedback received. Provide a template with questions they can use to analyse feedback objectively and identify concrete actions for them to work on.

- Keep up the momentum, reward buy-in

AS with any new initiative, effort is required to keep up momentum, otherwise

- Continue to evolve the continuous feedback platform
- Invest in leadership development. Being a manager is a tough job. Managers at all levels struggle with selection, hiring, training, coaching, and evaluation. Give them time and tools to learn, a framework for feedback, and a continuous development process so they learn how to become better.


## Common resistances to adopting CF
We need a fair and validated way to distribute compensation increases (don’t we?)
We need a record of low performance when we let someone go
We need to capture performance data in an employee’s profile for future promotion and other talent reviews, development plans, and career migration
We need a way to make sure managers are doing their jobs well
We need something for HR to do


## Our observations

- More employees buy into it than others
- Has a tendency to stagnate if format remains constant
- Poor forum for dealing with larger issues
- Without monitoring its easy for people to duck under the radar
- Struggle to keep accountability around short term goals
- Forces employees to carve out their own career path, which not everyuone is comfortable doing

## Key takeaways

- if you want to build high performing teams delivering feedback as often as possible is crucial
- not necessarily the right forum for renegotiating salaries, but can augment the existing Annual review format and provide much more concrete data from accross the year
- Separate the discussions about performance from discussions about potential and future career plans
