# M&S Commits to Digital Transformation by Outsourcing it to India

Stalwart of the British retail sector, M&S made a curious and conflicted announcement about their commitment to digital transformation last week.

M&S have been taking heat for a number of years about their ability to adapt to the modern retail environment, from their [lambasted £150m e-commerce platform relaunch](https://www.marketingweek.com/2014/07/08/website-problems-hit-ms-sales/) that resulted in an 8% drop in sales, to their [lacklustre attempt at trialling grocery delivery](https://diginomica.com/2017/05/25/marks-spencers-lack-digital-urgency-costing-dearly/).

The numbers have been equally disappointing, with their Christmas results [showing drops](http://www.iii.co.uk/articles/473924/ms-and-tesco-dive-christmas-results) in both food and clothing, the latter by nearly 3%. The market paints an even gloomier picture, with the M&S share price currently trading at a 25% discount on its 2017 high, and at nearly half of its 2015 ceiling.

Likewise M&S has been struggling to hold on to its senior digital talent, with former Apple e-commerce head [Marcus East leaving after just 14 months in the role](https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2017/03/ms-digital-director-quits/), early last year.

This position makes last week's announcement that M&S' answer to digital transformation is to appoint Tata Consulting Services (TCS) to take care of it for them, all the more confusing.

The [Press Release](http://www.retailtechnology.co.uk/news/6583/ms-commits-to-digital-transformation/) talks of agile methods, and pointedly reassures that transferring this capability to a consulting business best known for [delivering cost savings through offshoring](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/06/ey_plans_fresh_wave_of_indian_outsourcing/), is definitely the enabler to M&S becoming a "digital-first business".

Unmentioned in the Press Release is that the deal results in 250 staff [shifting from M&S to TCS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/09/marks-spencer-ramps-cost-cutting-technology-overhaul/), with a further 30 roles expected to "dramatically change". M&S expects the move to shave £30m from its technology spend annually.

Rather than recognising that true transformation needs to come from within the organisation through strong and savvy leadership, it's a real shame to see M&S take such a traditional and conservative approach to technology adoption - one that's seldom proved itself to be a real catalyst for success in the current fast-moving environment.

There are strong technology-enabled success stories M&S would do well to aquaint with, such as [Argos, with their radical digital reinvention](https://econsultancy.com/blog/69450-what-makes-argos-the-uk-s-top-multichannel-retailer) showing a like-for-like increase of over 4% in 2017 - having hired the former VP of Software Engineering at Amazon.com as their CTO. Or Ocado with their heavy investment in technology to the point of [selling parts of their technology platform](https://www.ft.com/content/036750de-d40d-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44) to other retailers, posting a [14% increase in sales](http://www.cityam.com/258021/ocado-set-deliver-impressive-annual-results-127bn-sales) last year. Just this morning [ASOS announced a 23% increase in UK sales](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42815593), citing the success of their same day delivery service. Showing that retailers who can understand modern customer needs and have the technology capably to quickly react can still thrive.
