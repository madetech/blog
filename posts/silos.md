# The creeping threat of company Silos

A silo exists in an organisation when a distinct group within the organisation has differing goals to another group.

In most organisations, there are groups of people that, usually, have an objective to fulfil by an agreed upon date. For example, the Sales team is set a mandate to increase the number of customers of the company by 10% every month. The Support team has internal performance goals, and one of them is to deliver support within a fixed budget.

These teams have the ability to innovate and choose how to meet their aims. For example, the Sales team could slash the price of the product. Immediately the product is flying off the shelves and sales are increased by 300%. So the Sales team is now celebrating!

The Support team, now with more workload, needs more budget to operate. The company cannot afford this extra operational cost given the productâ€™s new discounted price tag.

Before long, the company gets a bad name for poor support. This silo has potentially compromised the profitability of the enterprise.

What happened here is that this organisation failed to see the broader picture. Although this example is fictitious, it is easy to imagine happening in the real world.

## Software Teams

Being experts in software delivery at Made Tech, it is common for us to encounter silos within our client organisations. At Made Tech we believe in alignment around the goals of our customers. One primary goal that all of our customers have in common is that we deliver working software and to do that it is important for us to cut through silos.

In situations where our point of contact has a silo-goal, it can cause us to align around their goal. The result is that, potentially, we may align with a target that does not have the best interests of the organisation in mind. Aside from making it difficult to deliver simple solutions for the organisation, it can have an impact on relationships. 

This misalignment that points of contact can have within a customer's organisation are usually unintentional, so it is important to mitigate this behaviour with some prudent, deliberate activities designed to aid delivering great solutions.

### Communicating with Stakeholders

In the ideal world, points of contact are aligned perfectly with the goals of their organisation. To understand the needs and wants of the organisation in enough detail it is sometimes necessary to cultivate a list of stakeholders with differing views and goals. One technique that we have found works very well is the use of regular client showcases. These showcases ensure that the parties concerned in the continuous delivery of solutions are kept involved in the evolution of the plan, and feel a sense of ownership in the direction.

### Communicating with Specialists

A common way hierarchies organise themselves is to group individuals according to their specialisms. Within the tech world, this has resulted in teams such as Backend, Frontend and QA all having their different yardsticks with which to measure success.

A traditional silo is that of an IT department, viewed as a cost centre. Meanwhile, profit-building software delivery teams are depending on this IT Department for both hardware and software. It is not in the best interest of a company attempting to deploy a new software artefact to production to be held up by an another department that holds the keys.

### Uncovering hidden goals

Inadequate communication causes hidden goals, though it is not pragmatic to expect that you can uncover all hidden goals early on in the development process. In fact, it is common for hidden goals to be discovered late into the development process. Although it is prudent to expect this to be the case, it is reckless not to seek out hidden goals.

We have found that practising continuous delivery is part of an appropriate solution to uncover hidden goals. Given that it allows for a fast, frequent and robust feedback loop with stakeholders. We can showcase potentially consumable solutions in front of stakeholders often, which gives them an effective forum to voice their concerns.

We are not finished, however, as goals are probably still hidden even after showcases. The stakeholders produce artefacts of their hidden goals - feedback on the solution. At this stage, it is important to test assumptions about why they need those changes made. It is prudent to ask questions about any feedback, sometimes even when the answer appears obvious.

# How to break down silo mentality

* Establish shared goals to ensure that departmental goals have organisational alignment.
* Ensure the organisation has high-level goals, above all departments to which departmental goals help meet.
* Ensure organisational goals are directly related to the vision

Once this framework is in place, it becomes trivial for anyone within an organisation to set "highly aligned" personal, project, or product goals that directly impact the business achieving its targets.  

It is important to get departments to speak to each other on important matters. Departments should meet to discuss how they will attain their goals in collaboration. For example, a digital design department should meet regularly with a software engineering department to determine how they will ship an online software product together.

Departments should not communicate solely through hierarchies, such that a junior software engineer could and should be in direct contact with designers.

As this evolves, it becomes clearer that it is more efficient to have designers and software engineers working alongside each other to deliver a product. When people with different skillsets need to collaborate with the same goal, they should attend the same meetings, be aware of the same problems, and have a clear sense of shared direction and purpose.

Requiring formality or involving convoluted chains of command at this stage will only hinder collaboration. At this point, management shifts to a broader view of the company rather than micromanaging all daily details. Instead, the freedom granted to the team allows them to deliver continuously and ship products quicker. Tighter collaboration between skillsets leads to better product quality thanks to a better understanding of the issues. Formal long meetings can be a symptom of having too much bureaucracy around collaboration which can make it less desirable for employees to break down silos. 

The really innovative companies are creating shared offices where teams with diverse skillsets (potentially cross-departmental) can collaborate. A psychological silo can manifest itself into a physical one with real walls and closed spaces inside the company. An analysis on how the office space is laid out can help to uncover potential silos.

Leaders should encourage everybody to work with anybody to solve company problems. Employees should be able to move freely to another team if needed for the current objectives. The decision to attend a meeting should be able to be made by anyone if they believe it will achieve progress towards the higher company goals.

# Detecting silos

Observation is key to discovering silos, and in most companies, it isn't immediately obvious where they are. To give you a feel for what type of activities are indicative of silos we have compiled a list from the trenches to help you in your endeavours.

## Communication go-betweens

Unintended shielding of team members from end-users by another department. This shielding can lead to situations where software engineers are unable to get meaningful feedback on the solutions that they are delivering. Useful and accurate feedback is critical to shipping well-built and well-designed software.

## Prescribed solutions

Applying a top-down approach to decisions about "how are we going to build this solution?" as well as "what is the most vital problem that we need to solve?". Controlling every detail of a solution in a top-down fashion removes freedom from software delivery teams. Lack of liberty makes it less desirable or necessary for cross-functional teams to emerge (through interdepartmental collaboration). Moreover, this freedom is key to the production of truly innovative and uncomplicated solutions. Managers should not need to be involved in every single minutia of detail, only that the software delivery teams are solving the most pressing strategic issues.

## Passing the buck

When no department can deal with an unexpected critical issue, and every one of them that is alerted about the problem "passes the buck" to another. This shows that no team or individual holds true accountability for resolving that issue. The underlying problem is that it shows that people are not aligned with the goals of the company itself. This conflict with the business is showing that those departments passing the buck have formed a silo against the organisation itself. 

## Lack of robust goal setting

How the evaluation of each team's performance is measured can be a reliable indicator of a silo. In the most extreme case, every department has a balance sheet. This financially-led approach can promote unhealthy internal competition, stifles collaboration, and ease of mobility between teams. The symptom here is that the goals of two organisational units are at odds with each other. This is compounded if there is no clear process available to staff, through which they can resolve their differences.  

## Organisational separation

Budget allocation or in the extreme case spinning out separately registered companies introduce difficult to solve organisational impediments that make it difficult to deliver on "group" goals. Collaborating across balance sheets becomes politically risky, and can result in the onset of "officially political cultures".

## Competitive individual KPIs

When the performance evaluation of individuals prevents or discourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing there is no incentive to behave strategically. This friction can create problems internally to a single department just as much as cross-departmentally, affecting the ability to improve ways of working collaboratively and also for software engineers to discover requirements.

## Hiring 

The hiring policy is a good indicator of silos within departments. Departments can fight for expansion and prevent hires in a critical place. Hiring without a clear and mutually agreed reason in mind could lead to hiring in the wrong places or for the wrong reasons. Instead, a lot of companies encourage departments to compete over recruiting budgets; this doesn't solve real business problems. The interview process itself might highlight the competition between teams. For example, when other teams are unaware of the recruitment but will still be expected to work with the hired colleague.
