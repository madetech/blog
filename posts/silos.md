# The creeping threat of company Silos

A silo exists in an organisation when a distinct group within the organisation has differing goals to another group.

Company groups have generally an objective to fullfil which is reviewed by a certain date.
For example:
The Sales team is set a mandate to increase the number of customers of the company by 10% every month.
The Support team has internal performance goals, one of them is to deliver support within a fixed budget.

In order to meet their goal, the sales team slash the price of the product.
Immediately the product is flying off the shelves - sales is increased by 300% and the sales team is now celebrating.

The support team, now with more workload, needs more budget to operate.
The company cannot afford this extra operational cost given the product’s new discounted price tag.

Before long, the company gets a bad name for poor support and the profitability of the company is compromised.

What happened here is that this organisation failed to see the broader picture.
Although this example is fictitious, it is easy to imagine happening in the real world.

## Software Teams

Being experts in software delivery at Made Tech, it is common for us to encounter silos within our client organisations.
At Made Tech we believe in alignment around the goals of our clients.
One primary goal that all of our clients have in common, is that we deliver working software and in order to do that it is important for us to cut through silos.

In situations where our point of contact has a silo-goal, it can cause us to align around their goal.
The result is that, potentially, we may align around a goal that does not have the best interests of the organisation in mind.
Aside from making it difficult to deliver simple solutions for the organisation, it can have an impact on relationships.

### Communicating with Stakeholders

In the ideal world, our point of contact will be aligned perfectly with the goals of their organisation.
In order to understand the needs and wants of the organisation in enough detail, however, it is sometimes necessary to cultivate a list of stakeholders with differing views and goals.
One technique that we have found works very well is the use of regular client showcases.
This ensures that stakeholders are kept involved in the evolution of the plan, and feel a sense of ownership in the direction.

### Communicating with Specialists

A common way hierarchies organise themselves is to group individuals according to their specialisms.
Within the tech world this has resulted in Backend Teams, Frontend Teams, QA Teams, etc all having their own yard-sticks with which to measure success.

A common silo is that of an IT department, which is viewed as a cost-centre.
Meanwhile profit-building software delivery teams are depending on this IT Department for both hardware and software.
It is not in the best interest of a company attempting to deploy a new software artefact to production to be held up by an another department that holds the keys.

### Uncovering hidden goals

While hidden goals are hidden because of inadequate communication, it is not usually pragmatic to expect that you can uncover all hidden goals early on in the development process.
In fact it is common for hidden goals to be discovered late into the development process.
Although it is deliberate and prudent to expect this, it is reckless to not actively seek out hidden goals.

We have found that practicing continuous delivery is part of an appropriate solution to uncover hidden goals.
Given that it allows for a fast, frequent and robust feedback loop with stakeholders.
We are able to showcase potentially consumable solutions in front of stakeholders often, which gives them an effective forum to voice their concerns.

We are not finished however, as the goal are still hidden.
The stakeholders will product artefacts of their hidden goals - feedback on the solution.
At this stage it is important to test assumptions about why they need those changes made.
It is prudent to ask questions about any feedback, sometimes even when the answer appears obvious.

### Implied goals



## Effective Goals

- Complexity of goal setting?
- Hidden/implicit goals?

## Silo of one

- Hierarchy playing role in silos.
- Dysfunction - everyone wants to get bigger
- history of the company. One department historically bigger/more important.

## Departments

Silos can clearly be seen in organisations with departments. Most organisations naturally organise around specific skill sets, those skill sets often optimise their goal(s) for their needs.

Accounting, Human Resources, Product team, System Administration... All of these groups generally exist in most companies and their existence is now pretty established.

When the company becomes even larger, smaller focused groups generally appear, dedicated on specific parts of the company and on the product itself. A team can sometimes manage only a specific component on the product if it becomes big enough.

As the number of teams is growing and growing, the main danger of the tree model is now in isolation. Each team have their own goal on a month to month basis and might not communicate with each other. This is what is being called "Silos".



The system administration team can only be preoccupied with managing and scaling the machines and generally does not discuss with the engineering and product goals.

In the worst case scenario, teams might even compete with each other, thus destroying any chance for the company to produce meaningful work.

## An example of the past: Sony

Sony can be describe as an extreme case regarding their silo problems. The company almost went bankrupt due to internal fights between the teams.

The PlayStation team used to be physically separated from the other teams by being in another

- Can Silos ever be beneficial?
