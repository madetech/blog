# The creeping threat of company Silos

A silo exists in an organisation when a distinct group within the organisation has differing goals to another group.

Company groups have generally an objective to fullfil which is reviewed by a certain date. For example:

The Sales team is set a mandate to increase the number of customers of the company by 10% every month.

The Support team has internal performance goals, one of them is to deliver support within a fixed budget.

In order to meet their goal, the sales team slash the price of the product. Immediately the product is flying off the shelves - sales is increased by 300% and the sales team is now celebrating.

The support team, now with more workload, needs more budget to operate. The company cannot afford this extra operational cost given the productâ€™s new discounted price tag.

Before long, the company gets a bad name for poor support and the profitability of the company is compromised.

What happened here is that this organisation failed to see the broader picture. Although this example is fictitious, it is easy to imagine happening in the real world.

## Software Teams

Being experts in software delivery at Made Tech, it is common for us to encounter silos within our client organisations while we have work in-flight for our clients.

At Made Tech we believe in alignment around the goals of our clients. Sometimes it is difficult to get our clients to align around their own goals.

### Specialists

A common way hierchies organise themselves is to group individuals according to their specialisms.
Within the tech world this has resulted in Backend Teams, Frontend Teams, QA Teams, etc all having their own yard-sticks with which to measure success.

A common silo is that of an IT department, which is viewed as a cost-centre.
Meanwhile profit-building software delivery teams are depending on this IT Department for both hardware and software.
It is not in the best interest of a company attempting to deploy a new software artefact to production to be held up by an another department that holds the keys.

## Effective Goals

- Complexity of goal setting?
- Hidden/implicit goals?

## Silo of one

- Hierarchy playing role in silos.
- Dysfunction - everyone wants to get bigger
- history of the company. One department historically bigger/more important.

## Departments

Silos can clearly be seen in organisations with departments. Most organisations naturally organise around specific skill sets, those skill sets often optimise their goal(s) for their needs.

Accounting, Human Resources, Product team, System Administration... All of these groups generally exist in most companies and their existence is now pretty established.

When the company becomes even larger, smaller focused groups generally appear, dedicated on specific parts of the company and on the product itself. A team can sometimes manage only a specific component on the product if it becomes big enough.

As the number of teams is growing and growing, the main danger of the tree model is now in isolation. Each team have their own goal on a month to month basis and might not communicate with each other. This is what is being called "Silos".



The system administration team can only be preoccupied with managing and scaling the machines and generally does not discuss with the engineering and product goals.

In the worst case scenario, teams might even compete with each other, thus destroying any chance for the company to produce meaningful work.

## An example of the past: Sony

Sony can be describe as an extreme case regarding their silo problems. The company almost went bankrupt due to internal fights between the teams.

The PlayStation team used to be physically separated from the other teams by being in another

- Can Silos ever be beneficial?
