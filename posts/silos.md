# The creeping threat of company Silos

As every startup becomes bigger to form a company, departments naturally arise to answer specific needs.
Accounting, Human Resources, Product team, System Administration... All of these groups generally exist in most companies and their existence is now pretty estabished.

When the company becomes even larger, smaller focused groups generally appear, dedicated on specific parts of the company and on the product itself. A team can sometimes manage only a specific component on the product if it becomes big enough.

As the number of teams is growing and growing, the main danger of the tree model is now in isolation. Each team have their own goal on a month to month basis and might not communicate with each other. This is what is being called "Silos".

The system administration team can only be preoccupied with managing and scaling the machines and generally does not dicuss with the engineering and product goals. 

In the worst case senario, teams might even compete with each other, thus destroying any chance for the company to produce meaningful work.

## An example of the past: Sony

Sony can be describe as an extreme case regarding their silo problems. The company almost went bankrupt due to internal fights between the teams.

The PlayStation team used to be physically separated from the other teams by beeing in another
