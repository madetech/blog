# Polyglot disciplines

## Problems

One of the biggest problems with switching between programming languages is the context switching.

### Syntax

Differences in syntax d 

### Standard library

All languages come with a standard library, and very rarely are these similar.

### Paradigm

Ruby, Java, Python and C# share more in common with each other than they do with Erlang, Elixir, Haskell and Prolog.

There are languages which straddle these paradigm borders for example: OCaml and ECMAScript.

It's important to be well versed in the reasons these languages are different and embrace their strengths, and avoid their weaknesses.

### Culture

Every language, sometimes every stack, has a sub-culture and idiosyncrasies. 

As a polyglot it is more important to be idiomatic within a sub-culture, than it is to attempt to harmonise the various idiosyncrasies between languages.

## My polyglot toolbox

### Be familiar with the paradigms

It's important to learn new languages. The biggest piece of advice to those looking to become a polyglot is to pick languages that are vastly different to what you're working in now.

Working in Ruby? Pick a statically-typed OO language.
Know a statically typed OO language? Learn a functional language.
Know a functional language? Learn a logical programming language.
Know a logical programing language? Learn an old programming language.
Know an old programming language? Learn assembly language.
And so on.

Ultimately the different between C# and Java or Ruby and Python are not severe enough to cause too much mental stress, so pick languages far outside your comfortable norm.

### Find a mentor

Find someone familiar with these language

### TDD

The discipline with the biggest impact on my polyglot workflow is TDD. 

The primary guiding light of TDD is that the feedback loop between an assumption or theoretical understanding of how a language feature works must be quickly backed up by a passing test.

Every single struggle with a language feature is a learning opportunity, and that opportunity keeps value flowing within getting "stuck".

### Defer all technology decisions

### Separation of concerns

### Linters
