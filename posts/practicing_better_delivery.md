# Practicing better delivery

- Start work on a local branch
- All work pushed to feature branch
- Feature branches are short lived, i.e. for as long as they take to build, review and merge
- Pull Requests are used as peer review mechanism
- Master is automatically deployed to staging
- Once code reaches staging developer must test their feature
- Deploy production
- Move onto next task
